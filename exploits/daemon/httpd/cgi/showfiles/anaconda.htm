NAME

       Anaconda Foundation Directory NULL byte vulnerability

AFFECTED
 
        Linux/UNIX with Anaconda Foundation Directory

SYNOPSIS

 Synnergy Labs has found a flaw within Anaconda Foundation Directory
 that allows a user to successfully traverse the filesystem on a
  remote host, allowing arbitary files /folders to be read.


DESCRIPTION 

 The Anaconda Foundation Directory is a Yahoo style search engine
 based on the Open Directory project, www.dmoz.org. The Anaconda
 Foundation Directory allows you to dynamically integrate content
 into your site's own look and feel. This is the exact same content
 that Lycos features on their front page! Product pricing is $499 US.

 Anaconda Foundation Directory can be found at:
 http://anacondapartners.com/ap_afodpdemo.shtml

 Synnergy has recently discovered a flaw within Anaconda Foundation
 Directory that allows a remote user to traverse the filesystem as
 a request to the script using the $template=_some_file_. It is then
 possible to read any file contents with priviledges as the httpd.
 Although the script checks for the file extension (.htm, .html, .shtml,
 .stm) adding a trailing %00.html, (a NULL byte in URL encoded format),
 at the end of the request will force the script to open the file.

 Example: 

 http://www.target.com/cgi-bin/apexec.pl?etype=odp&template=../../../../
 ../../../../../etc/resolv.conf%00.html&passurl=/category/
 

 The above line if given will output the file contents of /etc/resolv.conf.

SOLUTION

 The vendors have been informed of the bug. It is advised to wait for the
 next patched version of Anaconda Foundation Directory to be released.
