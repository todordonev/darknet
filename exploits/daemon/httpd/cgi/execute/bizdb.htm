<pre>BizDB is a web databse integration product
using perl CGI scripts. One of the scripts,
bizdb-search.cgi, passes a variable's
contents to an unchecked open() call and
can therefore be made to execute commands
at the privilege level of the webserver.

The variable is dbname, and if passed a
semicolon followed by shell commands they
will be executed. This cannot be exploited
from a browser, as the software checks for
a referrer field in the HTTP request. A
valid referrer field can however be created
and sent programmatically or via a network
utility like netcat.

 Exploit:

netcat target 80
