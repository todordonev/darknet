Fuckin sendmail 5.61 -

#define MYUID to be your uid at the top of the program. make a file /tmp/x,
which is a script to make a suid shell compile the prog, call it say
/tmp/yo put in your .forward file:

"|/tmp/yo"F

now connect 2 the smtp port, and send urself mail FROM whomever you want
the shell as (anyone except root). Wait a bit (maybe up 2 an hour - depends
how often the sendmail runs un the queue).  Type mailq every so often (or
/usr/lib/sendmail -bq).  You will see your entry in the queue, before its
flushed.  It usually works, but sometimes it doesn't - you just gotta keep
your fingers crossed!
