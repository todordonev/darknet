  Solaris 2.5, 2.5.1 (Sparc & x86)
 
    To effectively  kill a  Solaris<2.6 syslogd  use in  the following
    manner:
 
  ./syslogd_kill <ip-with-no-DNS> <victim IP>
 
  My favorite is the 10.20.10.1 IP as this was the first IP I  found
  which killed syslogd and hasn't failed to work yet.  Then again, I
  haven't  found  a  Solaris  box  that  wasn't 2.6 that this hasn't
  worked on.  Let me know what you find.
 
  Sorry if  any credits  were deleted,  I really  didn't know  I was
  gonna distribute  this.   This is  the syslog_spoof  code that was
  posted to bugtraq a few weeks back, but modified to work with  BSD
  and Solaris.
 
  To compile under Solaris use:  cc -lnsl -lsocket syslogd_kill.c
 
  This code has been tested only under Solaris and FreeBSD 3.0.   If
  it doesn't work under Linux, just go get the old Linux code off  a
  bugtraq archive.
 
     lb@inext.net
 
  [NOTE: This may not apply anymore, I don't touch Linux. - lb]
 
  The  code  compiles  and  works  under  Linux.   Any Unix that has
  SOCK_RAW/IPPROTO_RAW should  be no  problem (you  may need  to use
  BSD-style struct ip  though).  It  may use few  improvements, like
  checking for  possible ICMP  Port Unreachable  errors in  case the
  remote machine  doesn't run  syslogd with  remote reception turned
  on.
