# A vulnerability exists in the installation of licenses
# for Sun's WorkShop 5.0 compilers, and other products
# which use the FlexLM license management system. As part
# of the installation process, the 'lit' program is run.
#
# This program insecurely creates files in /var/tmp. This
# can be used to create files owned by root, with known
# contents. The file will be created with root's umask,
# which by default is 0022.
