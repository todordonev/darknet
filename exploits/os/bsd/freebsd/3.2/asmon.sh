# A vulnerability exists in both the ascpu and asmon ports to FreeBSD.
# Ascpu and asmon are applets for the popular window manager AfterStep.
# They retain the look and feel of this window manager, and integrate
# well in to it's "dock" toolbar. As part of the port to FreeBSD, it
# was deemed necessary to give them access to /dev/kmem, necessitating
# them being installed setgid kmem. By passing a command line option,
# it is possible for an attacker to cause these applications to execute
# arbitrary commands with group 'kmem' privileges.  It should be noted
# that neither of these programs are truly part of FreeBSD. They are not
# part of any distribution of FreeBSD. Instead, they are part of the
# 'ports' section. The over 3000 packages included in ports are presented
# as-is, and in many cases have not been audited for security problems.		
#
# Affected:
#
#  FreeBSD 3.4
#  FreeBSD 3.3
#  FreeBSD 3.2
#  FreeBSD 3.1
#  FreeBSD 3.0
