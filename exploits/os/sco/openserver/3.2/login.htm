  /bin/login updates  ~/.lastlogin to  record the  time of  the last
  successful  login.   Unfortunately   the  file  is  opened   while
  /bin/login has  root privileges,  and no  checks are  made on  the
  file before it is opened; hence  a symlink may be inserted and  an
  arbitrary file created.

  % rm -f ~/.lastlogin
  % ln -s /etc/8LGMFILE ~/.lastlogin

  Logout and login  to the system  again, and /etc/8LGMFILE  will be
  created.  The file will be owned by you, and will be mode 600.
