 If one  does setenv  DEBUG_CSETUP 1  and then  runs csetup,  it'll
 create a file /usr/tmp/csetupLog, owned by root.  Sure enough,  it
 follows  symlinks,   follows  umask   if  file   is   nonexistant,
 overwrites  existing  file  keeping  original permissions.  csetup
 will  display  a  dialog  window  on  startup,  asking  for   root
 password.  However,  one can press  Cancel and it  will proceed in
 "read-only"  mode.   Perhaps  it  was  considered  to  be   enough
 protection, so it doesn't bother dropping root priviledges.

 The log file looks like:

    Remote Host: xxx Address : xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
    Set Initial Timeout (objectserver) : 1
    Get Lego objects Info
    Finished Loading objects info
    Networking Panel initialization complete!


 Log file contains nice text, not  just some binary crap.  So  from
 the OS  view point  it's a  shell script.   sh will  be invoked to
 execute it, and it'll try to execute command called "Remote".   So
 we can overwrite some system binary and make some program  running
 as root execute it.  But one has to have control over PATH for  it
 to be profitable.  That's where Irix helps us.  Some may  remember
 an  old  advisory  about  sgihelp,  it was recommended that people
 _remove sgihelp_  till patch  is installed,  pretty amazing,  huh?
 That's  because  all  those  GUI  tools  that  run  as root invoke
 sgihelp  without  bothering  to  change  uid  first.   Old sgihelp
 didn't care if uid/euid=0, you  can imagine what this means.   New
 one  does  drop  root  very  early,  but it doesn't solve the real
 problem:  many  GUI tools calling  external program while  euid=0,
 which is totally unnecessary.

 So,  do  setenv  DEBUG_CETUP  1,  symlink  /usr/tmp/casetupLog  to
 /usr/sbin/sgihelp, put  infamous makesh  called "Remote"  first in
 your PATH,  run csetup.   At this  point sgihelp  is nuked.    Now
 click on Help button, and enjoy.  Remember to make a copy of  real
 sgihelp first.
