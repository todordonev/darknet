Excuse the crappy coding, this code was written when I was very bored,
had nothing better to do, and felt like proving the point that automatic
firewalling is a bad idea.  The code spoofs FIN packets from sequential
internet hosts, starting at 1.0.0.0 and going right through to
255.255.255.255, sending 15 packets from each, one packet each to port
100 to 115.  Feel free to modify this code, if you use the code for
anything, please give me credit where it is due.
 
I hold no responsibility for anything this code is used for, I give no
guarantees that this code works, and I hold no responsibility for
anything this code does to any system you run it on. If you screw up with
it, its your problem, not mine.
 
The code compiles 100% fine with no warnings on FreeBSD 3.2, I dont know
about any other platforms or systems.
