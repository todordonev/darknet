 Exploit:

  When a user creates a process and it detaches
  from the current terminal, if the account is
  removed with the deluser,the process(es) stay
  active but disappear from the process table
  that ps (aux) scrolls.

                                         -alpen

 
 (nice for running sniffers without having to
   trojan "ps")
