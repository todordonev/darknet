 Exploit:

   The /dev/pts filesystem was mounted with
   options 'mode=0622' in Red Hat Linux 6.0,
   instead of the correct 'gid=5,mode=0620'.

   This can lead to alot of irritation if
   a user does:

   cat /dev/random > /dev/pts/<number>

   which will obviously flood root's
   terminal with garbage.
