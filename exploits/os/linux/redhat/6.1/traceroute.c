	argv0: at first it looks that this doesn't matter but since
             this is the value found at the top of the stack and thus
             it's length matter for the location of the shellcode.

	argv0: bs

      argv1: nothing is needed for this it should just contain
             6 bytes and a 0 (and off course it should be acceptable
             to inet_addr)
	argv1: only specific length
	       addr1 will become: 4 bytes from addr2 + zeros
             length so that p->size = last byte + 3 zeros
             p->prev_size = first 3 bytes + 00
             thus: 6 bytes + 0
             p data:
             size = 0x20 or so;
             prev_size = ((char *)p) - ((char *) eleet stack pointer)
             p = addr2 - 7 - 8

             so next data should be on addr2 + 0x20 - 7 - 8
      argv2: this requires much more thought, the ip_address should be
             so that p->prev_size and p->size make sense.
             p->prev_size should be so that prev can be found on the
             stack since that's an easy place to put it, p->size should
             be 0x20 or so so that we can put the next chunk in this
             argument too.
	argv2: ip addres so that: p->size makes sure next is
	       somewhere in argv2
		p->prev_size should point to eleet data on stack (through
		environment)
		spacing: next data:
			prev_size = 0x41414141;
			size = 0xfffffff0
			fd = some_random_pointer (or you could use him)
			bk = some_random_pointer
		after that: data for next (prev_size + size + fd + bk)
		prev_size probably negative
      argv3: contains the chunk used for prev and the shellcode
             including the jmp.
	argv3: eleet data on stack + eleet shellcode baby
             eleet data:
             prev_size = BS;
             size = BS
             fd = &ret_addr_change - 12
             bk = shellcode;
             shellcode = jmp forward + nops + code

      How to get the correct value for p?
