# Vulnerabilities exist in a number of pop3
# daemon implementations, having to do with
# their  creation  of  lock files. Affected
# include  Qualcomm's qpopper, and the popd
# included  as part of  the imap-4 rpm from
# RedHat. Lockfiles in  both implementation
# are  created  with consistent  local file
# names; the  RedHat popd  in /tmp,  with a
# fairly random name (albeit consistent for
# a given user),  and  in  the  mail  spool
# directory, with the  user name  prepended
# by  a  "."  and  appended   with  ".pop".
# Creation  of  either of  these files will
# prevent the  popd user from being able to
# establish a  connection to retrieve their
# mail.
