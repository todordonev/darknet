# A vulnerability exists in SuSE Linux, version 6.3
# and prior, that can allow arbitrary users to delete
# any file on the system. If the MAX_DAYS_IN_TMP
# variable is set in /etc/rc.config to be larger than
# 0, any local user can remove any file on the system.
#
# This is due to a flaw in /etc/cron.daily/aaa_base
# in SuSE 6.3, or /root/bin/cron.daily in older
# versions.
